 * Initialize the local recording of the user S/MIME cipher preferences.

 * important (first call records greatest preference, and so on).
 * When finished, it is called with a "which" of CIPHER_FAMILID_MASK.
 * If the function is called again after that, it is assumed that
 * the preferences are being reset, and the old preferences are
 * discarded.
 *
 * XXX This is for a particular user, and right now the storage is
 * XXX local, static.  The preference should be stored elsewhere to allow
 * XXX for multiple uses of one library?  How does SSL handle this;
 * XXX it has something similar?
 *
 *  - The "which" values are defined in ciferfam.h (the SMIME_* values,
 *    for example SMIME_DES_CBC_56).
 *  - If "on" is non-zero then the named cipher is enabled, otherwise
 *    it is disabled.  (It is not necessary to call the function for
 *    ciphers that are disabled, however, as that is the default.)
 *
 * If the cipher preference is successfully recorded, SECSuccess
 * is returned.  Otherwise SECFailure is returned.  The only errors
 * are due to failure allocating memory or bad parameters/calls:
 *	SEC_ERROR_XXX ("which" is not in the S/MIME cipher family)
 *	SEC_ERROR_XXX (function is being called more times than there
