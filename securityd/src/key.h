//
// A Key object represents a cryptographic key known to securityd and accessed by clients
// through securityd key references (KeyHandles). A Key may be raw or reference inside securityd,
// but from outside it is always a reference key, and we hide (as best we can) the details of
// its local storage and nature.
//
// Key is a very abstract class; it defines the minimal interface that all actual securityd
// keys must provide. Actual Key subclasses are produced by (subclasses of) Databases, which
// act as Key factories. Most Database subclasses will define Key class hierarchies to track
// their internal structure, but from out here, all we know is that Databases yield Key objects
// when asked nicely, and those subclass objects implement the Key protocol.
//
// A Key can be used by multiple Connections, even at the same time. It is possible for multiple
// Key objects to represent the same underlying cryptographic secret, so don't assume a 1-1 mapping.
//
// Key is completely agnostic as to how the key is stored or maintained.
// For all you know, it might be a virtual artifact of the Key subclass.
//
// All Key subclasses support ACLs. However, different subclasses may host
// their SecurityServerAcls at different levels of the object mesh. Don't assume.
//
// Key::attribute is there for a reason. If you want to check attributes,
// use it rather than returnKey - it may be much, much faster.
