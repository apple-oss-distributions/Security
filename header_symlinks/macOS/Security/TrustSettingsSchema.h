/*
 * A TrustSettings Record contains the XML encoding of a CFDictionary. This dictionary
 * currently contains two name/value pairs:
 *
 * key = kTrustRecordVersion,   value = SInt32 version number
 * key = kTrustRecordTrustList, value = CFDictionary
 *
 * Each key/value pair of the CFDictionary associated with key kTrustRecordTrustList
 * consists of:
 * -- key   = the ASCII representation (with alpha characters in upper case) of the
 *            cert's SHA1 digest.
 * -- value = a CFDictionary representing one cert.
 *
 * Key/value pairs in the per-cert dictionary are as follows:
 *
 * -- key = kTrustRecordIssuer, value = non-normalized issuer as CFData
 * -- key = kTrustRecordSerialNumber, value = serial number as CFData
 * -- key = kTrustRecordModDate, value = CFDateRef of the last modification
 *          date of the per-cert entry.
 * -- key = kTrustRecordTrustSettings, value = array of dictionaries. The
 *          dictionaries are as described in the API in SecUserTrust.h
 *          although we store the values differently (see below).
 *          As written to disk, this key/value is always present although
 *          the usageConstraints array may be empty.
 *
 * A usageConstraints dictionary is like so (all elements are optional). These key
 * strings are defined in SecUserTrust.h.
 *
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsPolicy        value = policy OID as CFData or CFString
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsPolicyName    value = policy name as CFString
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsApplication   value = application as CFData
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsPolicyString  value = CFString, policy-specific
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsAllowedError  value = CFNumber, an SInt32 CSSM_RETURN
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsResult        value = CFNumber, an SInt32 SecTrustSettingsResult
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsKeyUsage      value = CFNumber, an SInt32 key usage
 * key = kSecTrustSettingsModifyDate    value = CFDate, last modification
