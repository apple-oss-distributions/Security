	@function SecCodeGetStatus
	Retrieves the dynamic status for a SecCodeRef.
	
	The dynamic status of a code can change at any time; the value returned is a snapshot
	in time that is inherently stale by the time it is received by the caller. However,
	since the status bits can only change in certain ways, some information is indefinitely
	valid. For example, an indication of invalidity (kSecCodeStatusValid bit off) is permanent
	since the valid bit cannot be set once clear, while an indication of validity (bit set)
	may already be out of date.
	Use this call with caution; it is usually wiser to call the validation API functions
	and let then consider the status as part of their holistic computation. However,
	SecCodeGetStatus is useful at times to capture persistent (sticky) status configurations.

	@param code A valid SecCode object reference representing code running
	on the system.
	@param flags Optional flags. Pass kSecCSDefaultFlags for standard behavior.
	@param status Upon successful return, contains the dynamic status of code as
	determined by its host.
	
	@result Upon success, errSecSuccess. Upon error, an OSStatus value documented in
	CSCommon.h or certain other Security framework headers.

	@function SecCodeSetDetachedSignature
	For a given Code or StaticCode object, explicitly specify the detached signature
	data used to verify it.
	This call unconditionally overrides any signature embedded in the Code and any
	previously specified detached signature; only the signature data specified here
	will be used from now on for this Code object. If NULL data is specified, the
	code object is returned to its natural signing state (before a detached
	signature was first attached to it).
	Any call to this function voids all cached validations for the Code object.
	Validations will be performed again as needed in the future. This call does not,
	by itself, perform or trigger any validations.
	Please note that it is possible to have multiple Code objects for the same static
	or dynamic code entity in the system. This function only attaches signature data
	to the particular SecStaticCodeRef involved. It is your responsibility to understand
	the object graph and pick the right one(s).
	
	@param code A Code or StaticCode object whose signature information is to be changed.
	@param signature A CFDataRef containing the signature data to be used for validating
		the given Code. This must be exactly the data previously generated as a detached
		signature by the SecCodeSignerAddSignature API or the codesign(1) command with
		the -D/--detached option.
		If signature is NULL, discards any previously set signature data and reverts
		to using the embedded signature, if any. If not NULL, the data is retained and used
		for future validation operations.
		The data may be retained or copied. Behavior is undefined if this object
		is modified after this call before it is replaced through another call to this
		function).

 A subset of the work kSecCSStrictValidate performs, omitting work that

 entirely eventually, we makes this a private flag.

 @constant kSecCSSkipRootVolumeExceptions
 Resource validations are skipped for items on the root filesystem and therefore protected
 by the authenticated root volume policy. Passing this flag to a validation causes full resource
 validation even for items on the root volume to enable diagnosting issues with signatures
 on the root volume.

 @constant kSecCSSkipXattrFiles
 NOTE: this flag is no longer used and has become the default behavior.
 Indicates the validation should allow additional files caused on filesystems
 that do not support native xattrs. Only changes validation results if the item lies
 on a filesystem that uses xattr files and the file appears to be an actual xattr.
