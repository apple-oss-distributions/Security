		signed as members (by holders of suitable signing authorities) at any time.

	@param groupName The name of the application group. If you define your own
		application group, use reverse domain notation (com.yourapp.yourgroup).
	@param anchor The anchor certificate that is required to seal the group.
		An application will be recognized as a member of the group only if it
		was signed with an identity that draws to this group. If NULL, requires
		signing by Apple.
