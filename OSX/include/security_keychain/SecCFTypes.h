/* Singleton that registers all the CFClass instances with the CFRuntime.

   To make something a CFTypeRef you need to make the actual object inheirit from SecCFObject and provide implementation of the virtual functions in that class.
   
   In addition to that you need to define an opque type for the C API like:
   typedef struct __OpaqueYourObject *YourObjectRef;

   Add an instance of CFClass to the public section of SecCFTypes below to get it registered with the CFRuntime.
   CFClass yourObject;

   XXX
   In your C++ code you should use SecPointer<YourObject> to refer to instances of your class.  SecPointers are just like autopointers and implement * and -> semantics.  They refcount the underlying object.  So to create an instance or your new object you would do something like:
   
       SecPointer<YourObject> instance(new YourObject());

   SecPointers have copy semantics and if you subclass SecPointer and define a operator < on the subclass you can even safely store instances of your class in stl containers.

	Use then like this:
		instance->somemethod();
	or if you want a reference to the underlying object:
		YourObject &object = *instance;
	if you want a pointer to the underlying object:
		YourObject *object = instance.get();

	In the API glue you will need to use:
		SecPointer<YourObject> instance;
		[...] get the instance somehow
		return instance->handle();
		to return an opaque handle (the is a CFTypeRef) to your object.
		
	when you obtain an object as input use:
		SecYourObjectRef ref;
		SecPointer<YourObject> instance = YourObject::required(ref);
		to get a SecPointer to an instance of your object from the external CFTypeRef.
