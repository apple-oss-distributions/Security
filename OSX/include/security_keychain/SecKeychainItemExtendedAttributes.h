 * Extended attributes extend the fixed set of keychain item attribute in a generally
 * extensible way. A given SecKeychainItemRef can have assigned to it any number
 * of extended attributes, each consisting of an attribute name (as a CFStringRef)
 * and an attribute value (as a CFDataRef).
 *
 * Each extended attribute is a distinct record residing in the same keychain as
 * the item to which it refers. In a given keychain, the set of the following properties
 * of an extended attribute record must be unique:
 *
 *   -- the type of item to which the extended attribute is bound (kSecPublicKeyItemClass,
 *      kSecPrivateKeyItemClass, etc.)
 *   -- an identifier which uniquely identifies the item to which the extended attribute
 *      is bound. Currently this is the PrimaryKey blob.
 *   -- the extended attribute's Attribute Name, specified in this interface as a
 *      CFString.
 *
 * Thus, e.g., a given item can have at most one extended attribute with
 * Attribute Name of CFSTR("SomeAttributeName").
