/***
 *** Exportable key blob support.
 ***
 *** Currently there are three different ways of representing a feePubKey in
 *** an exportable format. 
 ***
 *** Raw blob:  basic native blob format. 
 *** DER blob:  DER-encoded. Currently not available in ANSI C version of 
 ***            CryptKit library without additional porting; the OS X version of 
 ***            Apple implements this functionality via SNACC-generated C++ classes.
 *** KeyString: NULL-terminated ASCII C string, suitable for application such as
 ***            distributing one's public key via email. Only public keys (not
 ***            private) can be exported and imported via KeyStrings.
