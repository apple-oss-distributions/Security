// acl_codesigning - ACL subject for signature of calling application
//
// Note:
// Once upon a time, a code signature was a single binary blob, a "signature".
// Then we added an optional second blob, a "comment". The comment was only
// ancilliary (non-security) data first, but then we added more security data
// to it later. Now, the security-relevant data is kept in a (signature, comment)
// pair, all of which is relevant for the security of such subjects.
// Don't read any particular semantics into this separation. It is historical only
// (having to do with backward binary compatibility of ACL blobs).
