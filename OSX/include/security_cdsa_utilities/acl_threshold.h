//
// acl_threshold - Threshold-based group ACL subjects.
//
// This subject type implements threshold (k of n) subjects as per CSSM standard.
// Subsubjects are stored and evaluated in the order received. Any subsubject
// is presented with all subsamples of the corresponding threshold sample, but
// not any other samples possibly present in the credentials. Subsubject evaluation
// stops as soon as the threshold is satisfied, or as soon as it becomes numerically
// impossible to satisfy the threshold with future matches.
// Note that this subject will reject out of hand any threshold sample that
// contains more than <n> subsamples. This defeats "sample stuffing" attacks
// where the attacker provides thousands of samples in the hope that some may
// match by accident. It will however accept threshold samples with fewer than
// <n> subsamples, as long as there are at least <k> subsamples.
