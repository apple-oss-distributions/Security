// SecretAclSubject implements AclSubjects that perform their validation by
// passing their secret through some deterministic validation mechanism.
// As a limiting case, the subject can contain the secret itself and validate
// by comparing for equality.
//
// This is not a fully functional ACL subject. You must subclass it.
//
// There are three elements to consider here:
// (1) How to OBTAIN the secret. This is the job of your subclass; SecretAclSubject
//     is agnostic (and abstract) in this respect.
// (2) How to VALIDATE the secret. This is delegated to an environment method,
//     which gets this very subject passed as an argument for maximum flexibility.
// (3) Whether to use a locally stored copy of the secret for validation (by equality)
//     or hand it off to the environment validator. This is fully implemented here.
// This implementation assumes that the secret, whatever it may be, can be stored
// as a (flat) data blob and can be compared for bit-wise equality. No other
// interpretation is required at this level.
