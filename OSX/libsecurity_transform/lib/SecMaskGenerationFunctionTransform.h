 @function SecMaskGenerationFunctionTransformCreate
 @abstract			Creates a MGF computation object.
 @param hashType	The type of digest to compute the MGF with.  You may pass NULL
 for this parameter, in which case an appropriate
 algorithm will be chosen for you (SHA1 for MGF1).
 @param length	The desired digest length.  Note that certain
 algorithms may only support certain sizes. You may
 pass 0 for this parameter, in which case an
 appropriate length will be chosen for you.
 @param error		A pointer to a CFErrorRef.  This pointer will be set
 if an error occurred.  This value may be NULL if you
 do not want an error returned.
 @result				A pointer to a SecTransformRef object.  This object must
 be released with CFRelease when you are done with
 it.  This function will return NULL if an error
 occurred.
 @discussion			This function creates a transform which computes a
 fixed length (maskLength) deterministic pseudorandom output.
